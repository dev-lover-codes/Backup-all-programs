## Why is this happening?

**OLD FORMAT (Database v1):**
- Stored files as "Blob" objects
- IndexedDB corrupted these
- Result: DOCX files can't be read

**NEW FORMAT (Database v2):**
- Stores files as "ArrayBuffer" (raw binary)
- Much more reliable
- No corruption
- ✅ Perfect DOCX parsing

## Still Not Working?

### If error persists after clearing:

1. **Manually clear IndexedDB:**
   - Press F12 (open DevTools)
   - Go to "Application" tab
   - Click "IndexedDB" in left sidebar
   - Right-click "DocViewerDB"
   - Select "Delete database"
   - Close DevTools
   - Reload extension

2. **Check the file:**
   - Open your DOCX in Microsoft Word
   - If it opens = file is valid
   - If it doesn't open = file is corrupted

3. **Try a test file:**
   - Create a new Word document
   - Type "Test"
   - Save as test.docx
   - Import it
   - If it works = your original file has issues
