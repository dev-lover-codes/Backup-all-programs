# 🔧 DOCX Error Fix Guide

## Problem
You're seeing this error:
```
Error: Failed to parse DOCX: Can't find end of central directory
```

## Root Cause
This happens because **old files** in your database were stored using an outdated format that causes corruption when reading DOCX files.

## ✅ SOLUTION (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Clear Old Files
1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome
2. Click the extension icon to open the popup
3. Click the **"Clear All"** button (new button next to Import)
4. Confirm when prompted

### Step 2: Re-Import Your Files
1. Click **"Import"** or drag & drop your DOCX files
2. Import fresh copies of your documents
3. All files will now be stored in the new, reliable format

### Step 3: Verify
1. Click on any imported DOCX file
2. It should now open without errors!

## Why This Fixes It

### Before (Version 1):
- Files stored as `Blob` objects
- IndexedDB sometimes corrupted these during storage
- Result: "Can't find end of central directory" error

### After (Version 2):
- Files stored as `ArrayBuffer` (raw binary data)
- Much more reliable in IndexedDB
- Converted back to Blob only when needed
- Result: ✅ No more corruption!

## Technical Details

### Database Changes:
- `DB_VERSION` increased from 1 to 2
- `addFile()` now converts files to ArrayBuffer before storing
- `getFile()` reconstructs Blob from ArrayBuffer when retrieving
- `contentBlob` property added for clean separation

### Code Flow:
```javascript
// Import
File → ArrayBuffer → Store in IndexedDB

// Retrieve  
IndexedDB → ArrayBuffer → Blob → Mammoth.js → Display
```

## Prevention
From now on, **all newly imported files** will automatically use the new format. The error will not happen again!

## Still Having Issues?

If the error persists after clearing and re-importing:

1. **Check the file itself**:
   - Try opening the DOCX in Microsoft Word
   - If it works in Word, the file is valid

2. **Browser Storage**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → IndexedDB
   - Delete `DocViewerDB` manually
   - Reload extension and re-import

3. **File Size**:
   - Very large DOCX files (>50MB) may have issues
   - Try a smaller test file first

## Success Indicators

✅ Files import without errors
✅ DOCX files open correctly
✅ Text and formatting visible
✅ No console errors
✅ Dark mode works
✅ Find & Replace works
✅ PDF export works
