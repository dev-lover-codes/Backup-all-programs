/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Emoji Tic-Tac-Toe Arena.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model. User profiles are strictly controlled
 * via user-based ownership. Game data is accessible to participating players, leveraging
 * denormalized `player1Id` and `player2Id` fields for efficient authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, secured by owner-only access.
 * - /games/{gameId}: Stores game instances, accessible to the two players involved.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the user themselves.
 * - Games are accessible to the two players involved.
 * - No listing of users is allowed to protect privacy.
 * - Data model relies on denormalization of `player1Id` and `player2Id` into the `Game`
 *   document to avoid costly `get()` operations in security rules.
