Instead of having all your code in one file, you can split it into multiple modules based on functionality or purpose. When you want to use the functionality from a module, you can import it into your current program or another module. This allows you to access and use functions, classes and variables defined within that module, you can avoid writing the same code repeatedly and instead reuse the code defined in the module.\n","\n","**Three main types of modules :**\n","Modules\n","↓\n","Built-in modules\n","External Modules\n","User-defined Modules\n","\n","**Built-in modules :**\n","These are modules that come pre-installed with python.

Reserved Words: Python has reserved words, also known as keywords, that have predefined meanings in the language. These words cannot be used as identifiers. Examples of reserved words include \"if\", \"while\" and \"def\".\n","4.  Length: Identifiers can be of any length.
