How it Works**\n","\n","1. **`listen()`**: It captures audio from your mic and sends it to Google's Speech Recognition API (free tier) to convert it to text.\n","2. **`process_command()`**: This is a basic \"Brain.\" It checks if your spoken words match specific keywords like \"open file explorer\".\n","3. **`check_code_syntax()`**: This tool asks for a file path. It reads the file and uses Python's built-in `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) module. If the code has bad syntax (like a missing bracket), `ast.parse` will crash with a `SyntaxError`, which the agent catches and reports to you.\n","4. **`open_file_explorer()`**: This uses `os.startfile` (on Windows) to launch the native explorer.\n","\n","### **5. Next Steps to Make it \"Smarter\"**\n","\n","Currently, this agent uses simple keyword matching (`if \"open\" in text`). To make it truly intelligent (understand context, answer complex questions), you need to integrate an LLM like OpenAI or Gemini.\n","\n","**Would you like me to show you how to connect this code to the Gemini API so it can answer questions and write code for you?**"],"metadata":{"id":"kN4JDVrTxJwB"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
